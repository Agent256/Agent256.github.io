<!--
  <div><p>Greetings! Chances are if you've stumbled across this small corner of the internet you already know me somehow, but in case you don't I'll start from the top;</p></div>
  
  <div><p>
      My name is Josh, but you might also know me as Agent256. I'm an avid developer and engineer.
    So far I know Java, Python, JS, and HTML/CSS, and I'm working on learning Rust. 
    I have worked on many projects such as the InterClient Dynamic Installer, the NORMAN discord bot, and a robot for FTC Competitive. 
    Almost all of my projects are open source on my Github page, and every project I do in the future will be open source under the MIT license.
    You can find a full directory of the things I made in the projects tab!
